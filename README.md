# React.js Chrome Extension Template
A quick way to get started building Chrome Extensions with React.

## Getting started
This project was developed and tested with `Node 14.17.0` and `yarn 1.22.15`.

Before uploading the extension to Chrome, you must first build it by running `yarn build`. Then, when uploading to Chrome, upload only the newly created `build/` directory in the project root. You will need to build again each time between uploads.
